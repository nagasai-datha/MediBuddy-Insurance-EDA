# MediBuddy Insurance EDA Project

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on MediBuddy insurance dataset to understand customer behavior, risk factors, and insurance cost drivers.


## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the MediBuddy insurance dataset to understand customer behavior and identify key factors affecting insurance charges.

The dataset contains personal and insurance-related information such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, region, number of dependents, and insurance premium amounts.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project are:

- Analyze insurance pricing patterns  
- Identify high-risk customer groups  
- Understand health and demographic impacts on insurance costs  
- Support data-driven business decision making  

---

## Dataset Description
The project uses two datasets:

- Personal customer data  
- Insurance pricing data  

These datasets were merged using Policy Number as a common key to create a unified dataset for analysis.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Analysis Performed

The following analysis was performed:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (BMI Category creation)  
- Univariate analysis  
- Bivariate analysis  
- Distribution analysis  
- Scatter plots  
- Count plots  
- Box plots  
- Correlation heatmap  

A total of 18 visualizations were created to extract insights.

## Key Insights

- Smoking status has the strongest impact on insurance charges  
- Obese and overweight customers have higher insurance costs  
- Age shows a positive correlation with insurance charges  
- Gender has minimal impact on premium pricing  
- Regional differences show moderate variation  
- Lifestyle factors influence insurance costs more than demographics

## Conclusion

The analysis highlights that lifestyle and health-related factors play a major role in insurance pricing. These insights can help MediBuddy optimize pricing strategies, improve risk assessment, and design better insurance products.
